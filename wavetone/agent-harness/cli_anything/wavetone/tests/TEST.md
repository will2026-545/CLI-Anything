# WaveTone Harness Test Plan and Results

## Test Inventory Plan

- `test_core.py`: 10 unit tests for project manifests, audio probing, session logs,
  and backend discovery.
- `test_full_e2e.py`: 5 E2E tests covering CLI subprocess workflows and real
  WaveTone launch smoke coverage.

## Unit Test Plan

- Create a manifest from a supported WAV file.
- Reject missing files and unsupported extensions.
- Save and load schema-compatible JSON.
- Add labels in sorted time order.
- Set tempo and analysis options.
- Probe a generated WAV file with the Python stdlib.
- Fall back to stat metadata for malformed WAV files.
- Append and reload session events.
- Resolve `WAVETONE_EXE` from the environment.
- Preserve inherited project and JSON context for REPL-style nested CLI
  invocations.

## E2E Test Plan

### CLI Project Workflow

Simulates an agent preparing an audio file before opening it in WaveTone.

Operations:

1. Generate a real WAV fixture.
2. Run `cli-anything-wavetone --json project new`.
3. Run `project set-tempo`.
4. Run `project add-label`.
5. Run `audio probe`.

Verified:

- CLI JSON is parseable.
- Project file exists.
- Labels and tempo persist.
- Audio metadata is correct.

### CLI Backend Workflow

Simulates an agent validating the installed WaveTone backend.

Operations:

1. Run `wavetone doctor`.
2. Run `wavetone formats`.
3. Launch the real `wavetone.exe` with a generated WAV and terminate it after a
   short wait.

Verified:

- Doctor reports all bundled files.
- Formats include documented WaveTone audio extensions.
- Real WaveTone process starts and is terminated by the smoke test.

## Coverage Notes

- Unit tests cover manifest creation, validation, persistence, labels, tempo,
  analysis settings, audio probing, malformed WAV fallback, session logs,
  backend discovery, and inherited CLI project and JSON context.
- CLI subprocess tests resolve and use the installed `cli-anything-wavetone`
  entry point.
- Real backend coverage launches `C:\Users\Hp\Desktop\wavetone2.6.1\wavetone.exe`
  with a generated WAV and terminates it after a short wait.
- Real backend tests are skipped automatically when Windows or a ready WaveTone
  extraction is unavailable.
- WaveTone 2.61 has no documented headless analysis/export API. Export
  verification remains a known gap until a stable non-GUI automation surface is
  discovered.
